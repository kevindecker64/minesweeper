    2. If the square is next to at least one mine, the number of mines touching that square will be displayed.
    3. If the square has no mine and is not touching a square with a mine, the check will fan out until a square that touches at least one mine is found.
        1. The numbers displayed indicate the number of adjacent squares with mines.
2. Right-Click a square you believe to have a mine.
    1. This will place a flag on that square, indicating a mine.
